## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Fork over upstream contribution: Cursor-only direction conflicts with upstream multi-agent goal
- Milestone 1 = full refactor + slim-down before any new feature work — owner is explicit on "不计较 token / 时间成本, 只要清晰正确"
- Big deletions go first (Phases 1–4) so every downstream refactor touches less surface area
- Flavor capability abstraction (REFA-01) folded into Phase 5 alongside CUT-05 — both edit `shared/src/flavors.ts`
- Documentation cleanup (CUT-12) is folded into the final verification phase since the VRFY-03 ripgrep check depends on docs being clean
