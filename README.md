# HAPI

Run official Claude Code / Codex / Gemini / OpenCode sessions locally and control them remotely through a Web / PWA / Telegram Mini App.

> **Why HAPI?** HAPI is a local-first alternative to Happy. See [Why Not Happy?](docs/guide/why-hapi.md) for the key differences.

## Features

- **Seamless Handoff** - Work locally, switch to remote when needed, switch back anytime. No context loss, no session restart.
- **Native First** - HAPI wraps your AI agent instead of replacing it. Same terminal, same experience, same muscle memory.
- **AFK Without Stopping** - Step away from your desk? Approve AI requests from your phone with one tap.
- **Your AI, Your Choice** - Claude Code, Codex, Cursor Agent, Gemini, OpenCode—different models, one unified workflow.
- **Terminal Anywhere** - Run commands from your phone or browser, directly connected to the working machine.
- **Voice Control** - Talk to your AI agent hands-free using the built-in voice assistant.
- **Workspace Browser** - Opt-in via one or more `hapi runner start --workspace-root <path>` flags: browse scoped file trees from the web and start sessions in allowed subdirectories.

## Getting Started

```bash
npx @twsxtd/hapi hub             # start local hub
npx @twsxtd/hapi                 # run claude code
```

`hapi server` remains supported as an alias.

The terminal will display the local hub URL. Use Tailscale or another network path you control for phone access.

For Tailscale and self-hosted options, see [Installation](docs/guide/installation.md)
